### Settings for the ensemble
ENSEMBLE:
  # [int] The number of ensemble members
  size: 40
  # [int] The number of parallel executions of the ensemble
  # int2lm and cosmo is called parallel_execution times parallel
  parallel_executions: 5
  # [bool] If a deterministic run should be executed
  det: True
  # [bool] If the deterministic run should be executed as standalone (True) or
  # should be appended to a running processes (False).
  det_parallel: True

### time settings, like start, end time etc.
TIME:
  # [str] The time format. This format is used to convert the time string into
  # a datetime.datetime object

  # [str] The start time of the cycling environment
  start_time: '2016-06-07 00:00z'
  # [str] The end time of the cycling environment
  end_time: '2016-06-07 01:00z'
  # [int] The analysis step width in seconds. Every non forecast cosmo run is
  # executed this amount of time and after this analysis step the the analysis
  # is calculated.
  analysis_step: 3600
  # [int/str] Cosmo is run as forecast for this forecast times.
  # String for a specific forecast time and integer as cycling forecasting in
  # hours.
  forecast_times:
    - '2016-06-07 15:00z'
    - 0
  # [int] The forecast is run this amount of hours. If the number of lead times
  # is different for different forecast start times this should be a list with
  # the same length as forecast_time.
  forecast_lead_time: 6

### Settings about the experiment.
EXPERIMENT:
  # [str] Experiment identification string
  id: '%EXP_NAME%'
  # [str] Experiment directory path. This is used if model output are relative
  # paths.
  path: '%EXP_DATA_PATH%'

# [str] The path where the GribApi is stored
grib_api: '/home/zmaw/u300636/cosmo_hh/code/utilities/build/grib_api/'


### Settings about the observations
OBS:
  # [bool] If observations should be used
  use_obs: True
  # [str] Path where the observations are stored
  obs_path: '.'

### Settings for generic model
GENERIC:
  # [str] Path where the bin is stored
  program: '.'
  # [str] The template stored in this path is used
  template: '.'
  # [str] The input files and output files are stored in this path
  run_dir: '.'
  # [str] The log files are stored in this path
  log_dir: '.'

### Default settings for int2lm
